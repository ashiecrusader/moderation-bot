# moderation-bot
A project I have started working on at the end of 2021, it's purpose was to serve as a moderation bot that would exchange information between roblox and discord.

It's quite simple since essenstialy all it does is write and read data to a database.

``/ban`` - command used for adding user IDs to a database collection labeled as game_bans, the game on roblox had a script that verified every user that joined the server, and kicked them if they were blacklisted.
